Pyth documentation 3.0

Each character is a separate token, except for numbers, 
strings, and python literals. Written in Polish notation,
with fixed arities for each operator. Statements are special, 
allow multiple lines.


Char, arity, begins line, mnemonic, details. When in doubt, similar to python.

  1 N blank             Primarily used to separate numeric literals. Also suppresses printing, which is default on.
! 1 N not               Logical not. Uses Python's truthy/falsy.
" X N quote             Begins and ends sring literals. Optional at end of line.
# S Y                   "While True:" loop. On error, suppresses error and breaks out of loop.
$ X N super-quote       Begins and ends Python literals. A Python literal is placed directly into the compiled Python output. Counts as one argument for arity purposes.
% 2 N mod               On integers, modulous. On string, string formatting. %<int><seq> is a modular slice, <seq>[::<int>] in Python.
& 2 N and               Logical and. (short circuiting)
' 0 N quote-file        Cat file, return file a list of lines. Take file neame as line of STDIN.
( I N tuple             Tuple constructor. Unbounded.
) X N close-paren       Ends functions, statements. Marks last line of statement, last arg. of function. Necessary for statements, unbounded functions.
* 2 N times             Like python, multiplication, replication. Cartesian product on lists, tuples or sets.
+ 2 N plus              Addition, concatenation. Set union. Prepend or append non-list to list.
, 2 N pair              2 entry tuple.
- 2 N minus             Subtraction, setwise difference. Maintains order. -<num><seq> coerces number to sequence type. Return type is type of first arg.
. X N point             Numeric literals.
/ 2 N div               Floored division. .count() method on containers.

: 3 N slice-sub         Python slice. :<seq><int><int> -> <seq>[<int>:<int>]. :<str><str><str> is regex substitution, substitute in a, b for c. :<str><str><oth> is regex search, boolean.
